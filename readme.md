## 💡Inspiration
“I think everybody in this country should learn how to program a computer because it teaches you how to think.”- Steve Jobs.
As rightly said by steve jobs, coding gives us the ability to solve complex problems and teaches us patience and logical reasoning. Taking this into consideration, I get inspired to code better every day. 


## 💻What it does
This is A Tkinter program that allows the user to create a dataset with 20 random entries (random) and store it in a 'users.csv' file. It even allows the user to either sort (according to First Name) the data in the 'users' file and store the sorted data in the 'users-sorted.csv' file or search for a specific entry in the file concerning ID and display all the details for that particular ID (if found).


## 🔷Steps to Use
1. Run the Code
2. First, click on the "CHOOSE" button to select the destination of the 'users.csv' and 'users-sorted.csv' files.
3. Then click on "START" to store up to 20 entries, randomly generated using the Faker API, and store it in a 'users.csv' file (Program 
    *You won't be able to click on the other buttons until all the 20 entries are added*
4. Click on the "SORT" button to read the 'users.csv' file, sort the data according to First Name using Bubble Sort Algorithm and    store the sorted data in 'users-sorted.csv' (Program 2).
5. Click on the "SEARCH" button to search for the details of a particular person concerning the ID (Program 3).
    *Before clicking on the "CHOOSE" button, all the other buttons will be disabled, and any attempt to connect will result in an error message (validation)*


## 🔨How I built it
* Tkinter: For Frontend
* Python: For Coding


## 🧠Use of Faker API
* Get the Ramdom Data required for the Project.


## 🏅Challenges I ran into
* Increasing the Complexity of the program to stand out from others.
* Creating an Interface using Tkinter for the convenience of the User.
* Compiling and running all three programs into one.
